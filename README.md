# React Tracker

## Approach

- The Tracker webapp shows the price of gasoline for different countries. 
- For now the data is stored in api/gasoline.js file and loads the data when app loads. 
- For now we are using a timeout of 500ms to imitate behaiour of loading data from backend. 
- The app allows the data to be sorted alphabetically and reset when clicked the sorting button again.
- We are using the charts.js library to show bar chart.
